My name is Eucharia (pronounced as ukeria) Onuorah. 
As a content marketer, I craft compelling sales/informational content and video scripts to entice your audience, drive engagement and bag the sales. 
As a storyteller, I court your audience into saying YES. Through strategic storytelling and creative content, I connect businesses to their target audiences to achieve their marketing goals. 
As a travel enthusiast, I love checking out new cities (lately I don't do that often, but when I do, it feels refreshing),  cuisines and cultures. 
As a foodie, I love eating and making good food. I also record cooking videos sometimes but just so I can re-watch them later, they never make it online (you might find it silly, but I find it fun).
